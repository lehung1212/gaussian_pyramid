  Written/online sources used:
    We informed our answers based on the code and text of the Image Pyramids
    lab for CSC-262 provided by Professor Jerod Weinman.
    The sunflowers image is by Bruce Fritz, taken on behalf of the USDA
    Agricultural Research Service, and is therefore in the public domain. 
    The brick image is by Colin M.L. Burnett and is released under the GNU Free
    Documentation License. 
    Finally, we used excerpts from the Szeliski and Forsyth & Ponce textbooks. 
    Szeliski Textbook: Sections 3.5-3.5.4, Richard Szeliski, Computer Vision:
    Algorithms and Applications, Electronic Draft, 2010. 
    Forsyth & Ponce textbook: Sections 8.5-8.5.2, David Forsyth and Jean Ponce, 
    Computer Vision A Modern Approach, Prentice Hall, 2003.
